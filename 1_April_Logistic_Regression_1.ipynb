        "###Linear regression is used when the target variable is continuous, and the relationship between the independent variable(s) and dependent variable is linear. It predicts the value of a dependent variable based on the linear combination of one or more independent variables. Linear regression is commonly used for tasks such as predicting stock prices, housing prices, or sales figures.\n",

        "###Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used when the target variable is binary (only two possible outcomes). It predicts the probability of an event occurring (e.g., a customer purchasing a product, a patient having a disease) based on one or more independent variables. Logistic regression models the relationship between the independent variable(s) and a binary dependent variable using a logistic function. The output of logistic regression is a probability score between 0 and 1. If the probability score is greater than a threshold value (usually 0.5), the predicted outcome is class 1 (e.g., purchase made, patient has the disease); otherwise, it is class 0 (e.g., no purchase made, patient does not have the disease).\n",

The dependent variable (churn) is binary, and the independent variables (customer demographics, usage patterns, etc.) can be used to predict the probability of a customer churning. A linear regression model would not be appropriate for this scenario since the dependent variable is binary and not continuous.\n",
